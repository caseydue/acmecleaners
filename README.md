Clean-up crew adding material not handled in earlier work on Venetus A


## Visual proofreading ##

All of the first 273 pages of the Venetus (through the end of *Iliad* 10) now pass DSE validation!  Kudos to the ACME Cleaners!


Our last step before publication of HMT 2014-2 is a final visual verification of the inventory for each page, which should be independently confirmed by two separate readers.  We are documenting that visual check in the file `visual_checklist.csv`.  If you verify a page, add your initials in one of the two columns for initials.  If you find a problem, post an issue on <https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive>, and note that in the `visual_checklist.csv` file that an issue has been posted.

 Links to visual inventories for each page are here:
